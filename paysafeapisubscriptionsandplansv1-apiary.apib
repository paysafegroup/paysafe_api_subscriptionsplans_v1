# Paysafe Subscriptions and Plans 

**QUESTIONS & COMMENTS**
 - If itemQuantity in subscription is, e.g., 2, does that mean the subscription will charge 2x the *amount* field in the plan for each billing cycle?
 - I tried to update a Plan with status of Active. Instead of getting error "PLAN-SUBSCRIPTION-1 Plan not modifiable", I got error 5068 "Either you submitted a request that is missing a mandatory field or the value of a field does not match the format expected."
 - Related, I could not reproduce the errors, so can someone confirm the HTTP Status Codes?
 - I could not **DELETE** a new subscription in the Test environment. Get Gateway Error 1007 "Error calling Future Payments". 
 - I am getting an **Invalid Credentials** error when I try the monitor request: "curl -X GET https://api.test.paysafe.com/subscriptionsplans/monitor" 
 - When I look up a subscription, the response has schedule.nextPayment object; but should this also be returned when you create the schedule?
 - In a request to view all plans belonging to a merchant, is there a way to filter results, e.g., specify a status? E.g., they want to list all active plans? Same for subscriptions?
 - How close to the nextPayment date can you cancel a subscription?
 - Are payments that result from this API identified as such in the back office Activity Reports?

# Overview

The Paysafe Subscriptions and Plans API allows merchants 


<a name="apikey" title="Authentication"></a>
# Authentication 

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system
and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:
 * Key ID – PartnerXYZ
 * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
 1. The Key ID and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key ID:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key ID and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

`Authorization: Basic
UGFydG5lclhZWjpCLXRzdDEtMC01MWVkMzllNC0zMTJkMDIzNDVkM2YxMjMxMjA4ODFkZmY5YmI0MDIwYTg5ZThhYzQ0Y2RmZGNlY2Q3MDIxNTExODJmZGM5NTIyNzI2NjFkMjkwYWIyZTU4NDllMzFiYjAzZGVlZGU3ZQ==`

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that they are used appropriately for your needs.

# URLs 

##  Test URL

`https://api.test.paysafe.com`

For example:

`https://api.test.paysafe.com//subscriptionsplans/v1/plans`

<a name="pagination" title="Pagination"></a>
# Pagination

In the case where an API GET request returns multiple results, Paysafe returns the first 10 records by default and uses HATEOAS links to provide page navigation. In addition to the default behavior, it is also possible to control the number of results and starting point by passing in query parameters as follows:

## Query Parameters for Pagination


| Name      | Description                                                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| limit     | This is the total number of records to  return. Default value is 10. Max value is 50. |
| offset    | This is the starting position, where 0 is the first record. Default value is 0.       |
| startDate | This is the start date in UTC. Default value is 30 days before the endDate.           |
| endDate   | This is the end date in UTC. Default value is the current date and time.              |

# Testing Instructions

The Paysafe Test environment can be used to test applications without actually running requests through the live system. It is important to make sure that your systems are working correctly before going into a Live environment.

# Using the Console Window
To configure and test the example in the Console window, click **Switch to Console**. 
In the Console window, you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint. 
For example, for most requests you must update the endpoint to include your profile ID (returned when you create a profile), which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the **profile_id** value. 
You must also update the Header to include your API Key, which you do by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value. 
To get your API key User name and Password, log into the Paysafe Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**. 
To then generate the API Key, concatenate your User name and Password, separated by a colon, then Base64 encode it, and then prefix it with "Basic ".
When you are ready to test your example, you can switch between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system. 
* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your profile ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.

## Create a New Version of a Plan [POST /v1/plans/{plan_id}/newversion]
<a name="createnewplanversion" title="Create a New Version of a Plan"></a>

Click on **Create a New Version of a Plan** above to see how to create a new version of an existing plan.

This request creates a new plan by copying an existing plan, with all its values, while incrementing the version. If you provide any plan attributes in this request to the *newversion* endpoint, those values will be used in place of the ones from the plan being copied.

**Note:** There are a few restrictions when creating a new version of an existing plan:
 - None of the elements in the Attributes table are required.
 - You can create a new version of a plan **only if** the plan you are copying has the status of INITIAL or ACTIVE. 
 - If you provide a name that is different from the name of the plan you are copying, the *version* will be set to 1.
 - The *status* defaults to INITIAL when copying a plan. The only valid values are INITIAL and ACTIVE.

+ Attributes
    + Include Plan New

+ Parameters

    + plan_id:`e067d83f-add7-4b6b-8884-dfa8693dde1f` (string, required) - This is the unique plan ID of the plan you want to copy, returned in the response to the original plan creation request.
