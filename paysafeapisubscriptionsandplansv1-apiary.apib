# Overview

The Paysafe Subscriptions and Plans API allows merchants 


# Authentication 

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system
and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:
 * Key ID – PartnerXYZ
 * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
 1. The Key ID and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key ID:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key ID and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

`Authorization: Basic
UGFydG5lclhZWjpCLXRzdDEtMC01MWVkMzllNC0zMTJkMDIzNDVkM2YxMjMxMjA4ODFkZmY5YmI0MDIwYTg5ZThhYzQ0Y2RmZGNlY2Q3MDIxNTExODJmZGM5NTIyNzI2NjFkMjkwYWIyZTU4NDllMzFiYjAzZGVlZGU3ZQ==`

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that they are used appropriately for your needs.

# URLs 

##  Test URL
In order to test your integration with Paysafe, use the following Test URL:

`https://api.test.paysafe.com`

For example:

`https://api.test.paysafe.com//subscriptionsplans/v1/plans`

## Production URL

# Pagination

In the case where an API GET request returns multiple results, Paysafe returns the first 10 records by default and uses HATEOAS links to provide page navigation. In addition to the default behavior, it is also possible to control the number of results and starting point by passing in query parameters as follows:

## Query Parameters for Pagination


| Name      | Description                                                                           |

| limit     | This is the total number of records to  return. Default value is 10. Max value is 50. |

## Tool Tips

To create the best on-boarding experience, Paysafe suggests that you include some tool tips within your form to help users. The following tool tips are used within our own on-boarding form. 

**User Name**
<ul><li>Must be from 2 to 64 characters long</li><li>Can contain both alphabetical and numeric characters</li><li>Must contain all lowercase characters</li><li>Can contain the following special characters: period, comma, hyphen, underscore, and parentheses</li></ul>

For example: merchant_com_24

**Password**
<ul><li>Must be at least 8 characters long</li><li>Must combine both alphabetical and numeric characters (e.g., J8k9b3p)</li><li>Must contain at least one uppercase and one lowercase character</li><li>Must contain at least one special character (e.g., ~¡-ÿ!@#$%^&*(){}`_,+=?;:.[]/\)</li></ul>

For example: Pay5@f3_999


# Using the Console Window
To configure and test the example in the Console window, click **Switch to Console**. 
In the Console window, you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint. 
For example, for most requests you must update the endpoint to include your profile ID (returned when you create a profile), which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the **profile_id** value. 
You must also update the Header to include your API Key, which you do by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value. 
To get your API key User name and Password, log into the Paysafe Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**. 
To then generate the API Key, concatenate your User name and Password, separated by a colon, then Base64 encode it, and then prefix it with "Basic ".
When you are ready to test your example, you can switch between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system. 
* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your profile ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.

# Bank Account Validation [/microdeposits]
<a name="microdeposits"></a>

Before Paysafe can remit funds to a merchant, their bank account information must first be validated to verify that the applicant is in fact the owner of the bank account associated with the merchant account, and that the banking information provided is accurate. The bank account validation method varies by jurisdiction and bank scheme.

|Jurisdiction   |Bank Account Type  |Validation Method      |
|---            |---                |---                    |
|UK             |BACS/SEPA/Wire     |<ul><li>Voided Check, or</li><li>Bank Statement, or</li><li>Paying-in Slip, or</li><li>Letter from Bank Confirming Account Name, Account Number, and Sort Code</li></ul> |
|EU             |SEPA/Wire          |<ul><li>Bank Statement, or</li><li>Letter from Bank Confirming Account Name, IBAN, BIC, and Swift Code</li></ul> |
|US             |ACH                |<ul><li>Microdeposit, or</li><li>Voided Check, or</li><li>Letter from Bank Confirming Bank Account Details</li></ul> |
|CA             |EFT                |<ul><li>Microdeposit, or</li><li>Voided Check, or</li><li>Letter from Bank Confirming Bank Account Details</li></ul> |
For microdeposits, Paysafe will attempt to make a small deposit between 0.01 and 0.99 into the merchant's bank account, using the banking information they provided during sign-up. By identifying this amount and returning it to Paysafe, you validate that the merchant provided accurate bank account data.

**Note:** If the microdeposit validation method fails for some reason, then the merchant must use one of the alternative validation methods.

## Create a Microdeposit [POST /{bank_scheme}/{bank_account_id}/microdeposits]

This is how you create a microdeposit request for an EFT bank account. For microdeposits for the various bank schemes, use one of the following as the value for *bank_scheme* in the request:<ul><li>achbankaccounts</li><li>eftbankaccounts</li></ul>

+ Parameters

    + bank_scheme:`eftbankaccounts`(string, required) - This is the bank scheme for which you are creating the microdeposit.

## Validate a Microdeposit [POST /microdeposits/{microdeposit_id}/validate]

As a result of a successful microdeposit request, a small deposit (between .01 and .99 of the currency of that account) is made to the bank account. To validate the microdeposit, you must send a microdeposit validation request that contains the exact amount of the microdeposit in the applicant's bank account. This verifies that the applicant is the owner of the bank account associated with the merchant account, and that the banking information provided is accurate.

**Warning:** Only three attempts are permitted for submitting the microdeposit amount. After three failed attempts, the validation is considered as having failed.

This is how you create a microdeposit validation request.
